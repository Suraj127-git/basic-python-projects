Repository for Basic Python Projects

Welcome to the Python Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of basic Python projects, each focusing on different aspects of Python development. Whether you're new to Python or looking to explore specific features, these projects serve as excellent learning resources.

## Project Structure

The repository maintains a consistent structure across all projects for easy navigation and understanding. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in each project directory:

1. **`src`**: This directory contains the Python application code, including modules, scripts, and other Python-specific files.

2. **`tests`**: Holds the test files for the project, including unit tests and integration tests if applicable.

3. **`README.md`**: Each project comes with a detailed README file providing information about the project, its purpose, features, and how to run it.

## Getting Started

To dive into a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the corresponding README.md file. These instructions typically include prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the project locally.

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
